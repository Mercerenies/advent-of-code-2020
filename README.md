# Advent of Code 2020

I'll be completing [Advent of Code
2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) here. Inspired by my [Project
Euler challenge](https://github.com/Mercerenies/eulers-melting-pot/),
I'll be completing each of the 25 days in a different programming
language.

Obviously, spoilers abound below. If you're planning to do Advent of
Code on your own, I recommend **not** looking at any of the code in
this repository until you're satisfied with your own solution.

## Day 1 - Forth
